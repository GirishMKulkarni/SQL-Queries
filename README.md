# SQL Queries Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries showcasing my skills with the Northwind and AdventureWorks databases. 

## Overview
- Explore a variety of SQL queries, including SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY operations.
- Demonstrate proficiency in querying databases and extracting meaningful information.

## Databases
- **AdventureWorks Database:** [https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksDW2012.bak]

## Queries
- **AdventureWorks Queries:**
- A total of 51 requirements with multiple ways to write queries encompassing the following
1. **Basic Retrieval and Filtering:**
   e.g
   - Displaying all data from `DimCustomer`.
   - Extracting specific customer details like first name, birth date, marital status, and gender.

2. **Conditional Filtering:**
   e.g.
   - Identifying customers with a yearly income over $60,000.
   - Retrieving customers with a specific number of children or within a particular marital status.

3. **Advanced Filtering:**
   e.g.
   - Extracting subsets of customers based on multiple conditions, such as marital status, gender, and birthdate.

4. **Join Operations:**
   - Utilizing joins to retrieve information from related `Fact` and `Dim` tables

5. **Aggregation:**
   - Calculating aggregate values, such as the total sales and average sales, and counting employees in various departments.

6. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
   - Employing CTEs for tasks like ranking products and finding employees with the highest and lowest sales.

7. **Window Functions:**
   - Using window functions for ranking and partitioning data, e.g., finding top-selling products and sales territory-wise analyses.

8. **Subqueries:**
   - Incorporating subqueries to filter and retrieve data based on conditions.
